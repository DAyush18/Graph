Graph DSA Questions Repository

Graph DSA Questions Repository  Welcome to the Graph Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Questions repository! This project contains a collection of graph-related problems, algorithms, and data structure implementations commonly used in coding interviews and competitive programming.

Graph Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental in computer science and are used in many real-world applications, such as networking, route planning, recommendation systems, and more. This repository includes both simple and complex graph-related problems that cover the core concepts of graph theory and its applications in solving algorithmic challenges.

The problems and solutions span from basic graph traversal to more advanced topics, including shortest path algorithms, spanning trees, cycle detection, and more.
Questions & Solutions

The repository includes a wide range of graph-related problems, such as:

    Graph Representation (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List)
    Depth-First Search (DFS)
    Breadth-First Search (BFS)
    Shortest Path Algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)
    Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms (Kruskal, Prim)
    Cycle Detection (in directed and undirected graphs)
    Topological Sorting
    Strongly Connected Components (SCC)
    Graph Coloring
    Bipartite Graph Check
    Detecting Bridges and Articulation Points
    Eulerian and Hamiltonian Path/Circuit

Each question has an implementation and explanation to help you understand the logic and approach behind solving the problem.
